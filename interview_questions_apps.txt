1) How to reset weblogic password

https://oracle-base.com/articles/11g/reset-the-adminserver-password-in-weblogic-11g-and-12c
$ cd $DOMAIN_HOME/security
$ java weblogic.security.utils.AdminAccount <username> <password> .

2) How to create a domain in weblogic if it's corrupted
3) Performance tuning task
4) cloning process
5) How to reset apps password
6) when do we run fs_clone

Ans:  
1) After aborting an online patching cycle.
2) After manually changing the run edition file system.
3) After patching middle-tier technology components.
4) After applying an EBS RUP.

7) why do we run actualize all 

Ans: actualize_all – Create new copies of all code objects in the patch
edition.

As each online patching cycle is completed, the database starts accumulating additional old database editions. As the number goes up, the system performance gets affected. As soon as the number of old database editions reaches 25 or more, you should consider dropping all old database editions by running the adop actualize_all phase and then perform a full cleanup.

Tip:  This procedure will take a large amount of time (significantly longer than a normal patching cycle), and should only be performed when there is no immediate need to start a new patching cycle.

Before starting, you should ensure that the system has the recommended database patches and the latest AD-TXK code level installed.

To proceed, run the following commands in the order shown:

$ adop phase=prepare

$ adop phase=actualize_all

$ adop phase=finalize finalize_mode=full

$ adop phase=cutover

$ adop phase=cleanup cleanup_mode=full

You have now completed removal of the old database editions.

8) some times cleanup phase runs for long time, why ?

Ans: Cause of the running concurrent programs, it waits for the programs to complete. In case we use CM_WAIT option and 
Give a particular time, it will wait for the programs to complete till the time mentioned against the parameter cm_wait and then will kill the program.

9) How to restrict a user in weblogic

And : By putting the user in particular group. Going to security realms, user and groups we can modify it.

What is difference between crosscheck all and validate?

Ans: Crosscheck checks all the files stored on disk and if any corresponding file is not physically present on the disk, It will mark it as expired.
Validate: By default the command only checks for physical corruption. Add the CHECK LOGICAL clause to include checks for logical corruption.

RAC

what if one of the RAC node has less RAM and resources, would the performance affected?
What is Scan listener?

How many nodes can we have in a RAC ?
How many voting disks can we have ? 2n-1 odd numbers 
what is OCR ? 
Is it possible to have a single node cluster ? Yes 
Which prcess regulates the voting disk task? CSSD

what is cache fusion?

In RAC databases the instances have their own sga and background process, 
at database level the buffer cache of RAC instance fuse together to form a global cache for the database to maintain the data intergrity. 
This is called as Cache fusion.The Global Cache Service is implemented by various background processes, such as

Global Cache Service Processes (LMSn)
Global Enqueue Service Daemon (LMD)

Can we add a node to RAC ? Yes 
What is GRD ? Global resounce directory, it has information of the database blocks 
Which process is responsible for cache fusion- > LMS ?
What is split brain syndrome ?


In a cluster, a private interconnect is used by cluster nodes to monitor each node’s status and communicate with each other. When two or more nodes fail to ping or connect to each other 
via this private interconnect, the cluster gets partitioned into two or more smaller sub-clusters each of which cannot talk to others over the interconnect. 
Oblivious of the existence of other cluster fragments, each sub-cluster continues to operate independently of the others. This is called “Split Brain”.
 In such a scenario, integrity of the cluster and its data might be compromised due to uncoordinated writes to shared data by independently operating nodes. 
Hence, to protect the integrity of the cluster and its data, the split-brain must be resolved.

Features of 12c grid ?

split brain handeling algorithm has changed.

Starting from 12.1.0.2, during split brain resolution, the new algorithm followed to decide the nodes to be evicted/retained is as follows:

If the sub-clusters are of the different sizes, the functionality is same as earlier, i.e. the clusterware identifies the largest sub-cluster, and aborts all the nodes which do
not belong to that sub-cluster
If all the sub-clusters are of the same size, the functionality has been modified as:
If the sub-clusters have equal node weights, the sub-cluster with the lowest numbered node in it survives so that, in a 2-node cluster, the node with the lowest node number will survive.
If the sub-clusters have unequal node weights, the sub-cluster having the higher weight survives so that, in a 2-node cluster, the node with the lowest node number might be evicted 
if it has a lower weight.

What is use of DBC file ?

The .dbc file is mostly used to define database parameters, stands for database connect descriptor file, used to connectto database, 
it authenticate users against database in FND_USER table.

If forms are not opening what is the possible diagnosing steps ? - http://tk-appsdba.blogspot.in/2011/02/oracle-apps-r12-forms-not-opening.html

How to tune a concurrent manager?
what is guest user in dbc file what is it's purpose ?

The .dbc file is actually the database connector descriptor file used to connect to database and this file is by-default located in $FND_TOP/secure directory, 
this file is quite important as whenever any program likes to connect to database like forms it uses dbc file where there you find the Guest_user_pwd ,
when the guest user connect it does not allow it to directly connect to the database but it first connect goes via this file and cross verify the password of the guest which is kept in this file.

what's the purpose of FNDLOAD ?

FNDLOAD is a concurrent program that allows the moving of metadata between Oracle Applications between database and text file. 
It allows downloading of meta data directly via a UNIX command and then can be moved and uploaded to another instance. 
The FNDLOAD conversion of meta data into Oracle is specified by a configuration file in the .LCT (Loader configuration file). 
The actual metadata file that FNDLOAD provides is in .LDT (Loader data file) format. Oracle provides .lct files for the following and are located in this directory:

1
$FND_TOP/patch/115/import

FNDLOAD apps/D_gd3682 0 Y UPLOAD $FND_TOP/patch/115/import/afcpprog.lct XX_NOTES_DATA_FIX_CP.ldt - WARNING=YES UPLOAD_MODE=REPLACE CUSTOM_MODE=FORCE

What's the difference between FNDLOADER and SQLLOADER ?

SQL Loader is a tool in Oracle to load data from flat file into tables.  Data objects 
Its very useful when you are trying to load data into oracle from a non-oracle system. Code onjects
